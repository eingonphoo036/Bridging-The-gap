*A full-stack web application designed to simplify relocation for international students by integrating housing search and essential goods access into one unified platform.*

---

## 🌍 Overview

Bridging the Gap was developed as a final-year dissertation project at Coventry University. It addresses common challenges faced by international students relocating to a new country — specifically the difficulty of finding accommodation and purchasing essential household items from one place. The platform combines housing listings with a price comparison tool for essential goods.
